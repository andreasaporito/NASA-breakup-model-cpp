# TEST: Zero Relative Velocity
# Both satellites have IDENTICAL velocity vectors
# No relative motion - not a collision (for comparison)
# Manual position/velocity override (not using TLE)

  - id: 24946
    name: "Iridium 33 (v=7.5 km/s)"
    satType: SPACECRAFT
    mass: 556.0                    # kg - same as baseline
    radius: 1.0                    # m
    position: [6800000, 0, 0]      # m - LEO altitude
    velocity: [7500, 0, 0]         # m/s - circular orbit velocity
